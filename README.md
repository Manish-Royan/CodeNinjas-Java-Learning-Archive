## ⚠️ Archived & Read-Only Repository

This is a preserved snapshot of my **early Java learning journey** from BCA fresher days (~2 years ago), while following Coding Ninjas basics (up to roughly Chapter 5).

- Personal practice files with my own small modifications/experiments.
- Stopped updating after early chapters.
- Some content based on course exercises.

**To fully respect course/platform policies**, this is now in a dedicated archived repo and read-only.  
**Do NOT use code from here** for current learning/projects — refer to official Coding Ninjas materials, Oracle docs, freeCodeCamp, etc. instead.

Kept only as a personal historical record.  
Thanks for understanding! ☕ → 🚀
